## Some Usage Instructions

1. Create the corresponding pages using the provided templates from Wakusei. These templates are designed to display the content and features specific to your travel agency website.
2. Create categories for your posts. The default categories required for the theme include "destinations," "booking," and "tour-and-activities." Assign each post to the relevant category to ensure proper organization and display on your website.
3. The sidebar of the theme acts as the menu for your site.
4. The "page-contact" template is provided in the theme but does not include a built-in contact form. We recommend using popular form generators and SMTP plugins to generate and handle the contact form functionality. Choose a solution that best suits your needs and integrate it into the "page-contact" template to enable visitors to contact your travel agency.
5. The "page-sections" template is designed to display posts based on the category specified in the URL. For example, to display posts from the "destinations" category, the URL would be "/category/?category_name=destinations". Ensure your posts are assigned to the appropriate categories and use the corresponding URLs to display the desired content.
6. If you intend to expand and customize the Wakusei theme further, keep in mind that using Tailwind CSS with WordPress may present some complexities. Ensure you have a good understanding of both technologies and their integration to avoid any unexpected challenges.
